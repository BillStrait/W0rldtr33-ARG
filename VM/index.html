                        It's for Ratatoskr, the squirrel that runs up and down the worldtree, Yggdrasil, carrying messages between the eagle at the top and the snake at the bottom. The Ratates are the people who carry messages between the different groups of hackers. Ethically, of course.

                                        I'm glad you like it. I'm not sure who came up with it, but I think it was 808. Welcome aboard, by the way. I'm so happy you're joining us!

                I'm not sure what to make of that onion site I sent at work. Did your team come up with anything D4v1? I don't think they're responsible for the hack, but it seems like there's something to it.

                        I'll have the team take a look at it today. We'll get back to you in your morning. I'm not sure what to make of it either. It's definitely not a coincidence that we found it, but I don't know what it means.

                Okay, C4r0l, here's your first challenge. 
                You're going to take the answer to my riddles three and use it to decrpyt my cipher. We call this the turing test.
                The cipher is: zpwik skydu gqrol rug<br/>
                When you have the answer, it will be three words. From there you <span class="wordFromGod">808's instructions are irrelavant. You must figure out what to do next.</span><br/>
                Riddle 1: I saw a cloud with loss and love.<br/>
                Riddle 2: The president's daughter has gone away to Spain. A young Count teams up with a familiar foe.<br/>
                Riddle 3: In remote Montana the holy man and his siren are on a first name basis.

                        We need to get 808 some more free time. Maybe then he can play a video game from this decade.
