        Very good. You know what the Ratates were up to, and how they were prepared. Beyond this point you may have a more difficult time locating information. Use your brains, use the tools provided. Good luck.

                 I just got word that everyone in D4v1's office went ballistic. They murdered everyone. D4v1 was working from home, so he's ... safe? He stopped 
                 spamming the thread, but I don't know how to reach out to him. I'm watching Indian news channels, but so far nothing.

                        I just don't understand. They were looking at a website? How does a website turn someone into a spree killer? Why are 808 and D4v1 relatively 
                        safe? I'm so confused. What did you see when you were at 808's?

                                I went over with Snuggles and 808 was laying on the floor, twitching. There was some weird chant whispering coming from his PC and 
                                I just turned it off. Snuggles started licking his face. I fumbled to get the music on my phone off while trying to call 911. It was so 
                                much all at once, I don't know.

                                        We have to take that website offline before this happens to someone else. What's the website? What's the password? I'll do it.

                                                The website is 0000000000 - D4v1 knows the password. I have no idea
                                                 how to get it. Maybe we can figure out how to get D4v1 back by investigating the site?
