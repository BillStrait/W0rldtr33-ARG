                I'm not sure what to make of that onion site I sent at work. Did your team come up with anything D4v1? I don't think they're responsible for the hack, but it seems like there's something to it.

                        I'll have the team take a look at it today. We'll get back to you in your morning. I'm not sure what to make of it either. It's definitely not a coincidence that we found it, but I don't know what it means.
