Following the notion of the "World Tree" connecting the realms, I think puzzles should be loosely Norse mythology themed. 

## Step 1: An Introduction to Ph34r

1. A new user joins the discord and says something relatively benign. 
2. A few days of conversation bury the comment.
3. The user's message is edited with a clue to a clue that leads to a clearnet website.
	1. Sufficiently glitched out text?
	2. An image with the URL nearly illegible? 
	3. Maybe Ph34r says "You wouldn't understand little squirrels. We're going to Build It Beautiful" instead of "We're making something beautiful." Free plug for your buddy's business, and maybe that'll get them thinking about squirrels related to WorldTrees.
	4. Is r4t4t0skr.squarespace.com taken? Might be a good domain for our heroes. 
4. Ph34r says something like "I'll find you" to incite action. 
5. Players look into it, find the old message, and are introduced to our heroes.

## Step 2: Stop spreading the news...

1. Our players find themselves on a virtual machine. The following items are presented.
	1. Undernet - 2023-06-30.txt
	2. * Undernet - 2023-07-15.txt
	3. * Undernet - 2023-07-26.txt (dates should be updated to roughly this scale, with the final date being a few days before the start of the event)
	4. * ServerNuke3000.exe
		1. This will have two fields: URL, Remote Admin Password
	5. A link to Brave and/or TOR browser.
	6. A link to https://cryptii.com/
	7. A link to https://md5hashing.net/
	8. A link to Audacity
	9. A link to GiMP
	10. A link to https://brandfolder.com/workbench/extract-metadata
2. The earliest file is an irc log. In the file they discuss cryptii in a general way, and they make c4r0l solve an Enigma cipher - they slip in a roman numberal and two numbers three times. The ciphertext starts with the plug settings. The solution is "Squirrely Girly" - the password used for document 2. 4l1c3 and 808 are established as neighbors. 
   
   Our heroes:
		1. 4l1c3
			1. A toxic optimist-type. She's perky to a fault. She's got a new puppy named Snuggles.
		2. 808
			1. Dude works a lot, and he's often on d4v1's schedule. He's a techy, d4v1 is his cousin.
		3. c4r0l
			1. Our viewpoint character. She's interested in learning information security. Sensible and concerned about the events around her. She must take action!
		4. d4v1
			1. d4v1 is also a techy. He works with 808 on information security analysis. d4v1 is on India time, and 808 is the company liaison for the India team. 
3. This chatlog starts with 808 and d4v1 goofing around on a site they mentioned before c4r0l joined the conversation. They're talking about how they had the team take a look at the site. Suddenly 808 stops responding. 4l1c3 sees weird lights in 808's window, so she goes to check it out. She teases "Did you fall asleep? Snuggles and I are going to come over there and blare \<happy hardcore artist name here\>" - D4v1 mentions he's still browsing, then he stops responding too. 4l1c3 comes back. 808 is really out of it. He keeps mumbling random letters. It's a Vigenere cipher for "he's using a sha one hash" - 4l1c3 relays this, and then d4v1 sends a message in spooky-font, it's "e4076e8fc51c6ca8ebc300f19e89929ac355bbfc" - which is a sha1 hash for "please help me." 808's team chat is open on his phone. Several people are freaking out, and the India office is in bloody chaos. 
4. "Please Help Me" is the password for the last file. 808 is stable, but not back to normal. He seems to be seeking out extreme pleasure. 4l1c3 doesn't want to be around him much. The India team is offline. People with their own offices were saved when someone ran a knife through a coworker... and the power junction box behind them. D4v1 is still unconscious. 808 doesn't want to talk about what he saw. When the topic is broached, he repeats "shut it down shut it down shut it down" until Snuggles licks his face. 
   
   This log is between 4l1c3 and c4r0l. 4l1c3 expositions to c4r0l, then 4l1c3 passes along a link to an image - the one that seems to have started 808 and d4v1's investigation. The image has metadata pointing to an onion url.

## Step 3: 

1. Users get to the TOR site, it loads a JPG of sticky-wet muscles rending under talon-tipped nails. Ram horned skulls adorn alters to forgotten/unknown gods. AI's eerie-ness works in our favor here. We'll add some red channel data here; it'll be a simple number alphabet, dots in a tic-tac-toe grid laid out as such
   1|2|3
   ------
   4|5|6
   -----
   7|8|9
   
   The first line of cipher will be the numbers 0-9. The second line will be a number mentioned in by d4v1 in chat log 2. The number 4 repeats over and over here. 
2. The first video is presented. Poorly written english leaves a clue to step 3
3. The second video is presented.
